                The aim of this website is to summarize the expendings of Manchester City Council since 2012.
            </p>
            <p>The files published by <abbr title="Manchester City Council">MCC</abbr> are collated, processed/cleaned
            and normalized to ease interpretation through the graphs.</p>
            <p>Selecting the year will show a brief summary of the transactions in that period. Any amounts paid to <abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr> have been excluded given
                the relatively large amounts, but it is also a governing public body. You can find <abbr title="Greater Manchester Combined Authority">GMCA</abbr>'s own
                spending reports {extLink('here', "https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/who-we-are/accounts-transparency-and-governance/transparency-reports-finance/")}.
            </p>
            <p>The supplier rank only contains the top 55 suppliers by total amount received since 2012.
                We are planning to allow to explore all suppliers.</p>

            <Heading size="md">Challenges to work on</Heading>
            <p>The main challenge is the slightly different naming of the same company across files and rows. For example, <code><small>k & l gates llp</small></code>/<code><small>k and l gates llp</small></code> or <code><small>building services technical sup ltd</small></code>/<code><small>building services technical support</small></code>
            . This can make aggregating data difficult.</p>
